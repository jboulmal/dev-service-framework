Hyperty Development
-------------------

**Introduce the Hyperty Concept, the Criteria to use or not to use Hyperties, the APIs to be used and code snippets**

### Hyperty Concept
D2.1 defines Hyperty as a secure user associated microservice, which is can be deployed either on a web runtime environment, on an end-user device or on a networked server. The main characteristics of a Hyperty include:
* *User association* : A Hyperty instance is associated to a “User” (e.g. Human beings, physical objects, physical spaces, organizations) through an Identity, even if this User can be anonymous in some cases.
* *Data Synchronization Communication*: Hyperties interact with each other through data synch objects by using the Reporter – Observer communication pattern.
* *Protocol Agnostic*: Through the protocol-on-the-fly concept, Hyperties are network protocol agnostic. In other words, the data synchronization communication between Hyperties is not dependent on a specific network protocol. Communication is accomplished via a common data schema that describes the data synch objects used.
