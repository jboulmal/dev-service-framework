### ReThink Framework Overview

*Describe concepts*  
*Big picture with Devices/CSP (including support services + IdPs)*

*based on d2.1 Introduction. This paragraph should be shorter*

The reTHINK Framework is built around [Hyperlinked Entities (hyperties)](docs/manuals/hyperty.md) that leverages the protocol-on-the-fly (ProtoFly) concept to avoid creating or modifying standard network protocols, but moving instead towards an API based flat service architecture. The reTHINK project envisages a global network of interconnected hyperties that are executed in web runtime environment on endpoints or edge-network servers. The reTHINK Framework functions are based on a series of such hyperties that are generated by the service provider, and are downloaded to the users endpoints. The hyperty modules represent a set of services that are stored in a Catalogue. The instantiated versions of these hyperties are registered in a Registry, which represents authenticated users who are available for in-coming connectivity service. Therefore, the Registry serves as a location manager and is used for user discovery. A user can be a human being, a group or, a connected object (e.g. building room with sensors). Users have independent identities that are maintained by Identity Providers (IdPs) that are independent organizations. On enquiry, these IdPs vouch for users authenticity and return the URL of the users domain, which enables finding destination users. The users identities are based on their personal and confidential data, which is verified by other solicited data, but such private information is only divulged under user-controlled privacy rules.

More information about reTHINK Framework is provided here:

-	[Hyperty Concept Overview](docs/manuals/hyperty.md)
-	[Hyperty Messaging Framework Overview](docs/manuals/hyperty-messaging-framework.md)
-	[Hyperty Data Synchronisation: Reporter - Observer communication model](docs/manuals/p2p-data-sync.md)
-	[Hyperty Trust and Security Model](docs/manuals/hyperty-trust.md)

The current repository provides the Hyperty Service Framework, comprised by a set of libs to develop, and test new Hyperties. Check below a quick guideline on how to use the Hyperty Service Framework. In order to setup your own reTHINK Framework, you should install the following components (docker images available):

-	the [Hyperty Catalogue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue)
-	the [Hyperty Domain Registry](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain)
-	the [Vertx Message Node](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx). Other Message Nodes will be available including for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Very soon we will provide a live public reTHINK environment, to let you publish and try your Hyperties or Apps without the need to install anything. Demos with Apps and Hyperty examples are provided below.

### Getting Started

*Hello World Chat application A send msg to B with a connection Hyperty already provided*  
*Hello World WebRTC application A calls B with a Connector Hyperty already provided*  
*IoT application with a sensor emulation (Get the room temperature)*

Different development manuals are available, including:

-	[Hyperty Development manual](development-of-hyperties.md)
-	[Application Development manual](development-of-apps.md)
-	[Message Nodes and Protostubs Development manual](development-of-protostubs-and-msg-nodes.md)

#### <a id="how-to-install"></a>How to install this repository like a NPM Module;

How to include this repository in other software parts, like [dev-runtime-browser](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser), [dev-runtime-node](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-node) or [dev-runtime-core](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core);

```shell
jspm install service-framework=github:github:reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework@develop
```

or

```shell
npm install github:reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework#develop --save
```

**New Way**

To import the dev-service-framework modules now you need to do:
```javascript

// This is the default class exported;
import CatalogueFactory from 'service-framework/dist/CatalogueFactory';

// This is the other classes exported
import {HypertyDescriptor, ProtocolStubDescriptor, SourcePackage} from 'service-framework/dist/CatalogueFactory';

// or
import MessageFactory from 'service-framework/dist/MessageFactory';

// or
import {Syncher, DataObjectReporter, DataObjectObserver} from 'service-framework/dist/Syncher';

```

**Old Way**
```javascript
import {Syncher, MessageFactory} from 'service-framework';

console.log('Syncher: ', Syncher);
console.log('MessageFactory: ', MessageFactory);

```

At this moment, both methods are supported, but the **"old way"** only will be supported until the runtime-core and other repositories update to the **"new way"**;

if you have problems with the `npm install` service framework module, you may need following the steps present on [Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). and select operation system you are using.

#### Setup Environment

On the first time you are cloning this repository, you need to run the command `npm run init-setup`;

After running successfully this command you will have 2 folders (node_modules and vendor), these folders are excluded from the commit process, and are only for development.

if you already have the project configured on your machine, you only need run the command `npm install` to add new dependencies;

if you have some trouble with the environment, you can open an issue;

Address data factory is based on https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url, which transforms the source file with some minor changes. In this project, I have added a rule to perform that changes. Just do:

npm run-script build

##### Javascript Environment

JavaScript code should be written in ES6. There are direct dependencies from nodejs and npm, these can be installed separately or in conjunction with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

##### dependencies:

-	nodejs
-	npm
-	karma - Make the communication between unit test tool and jenkins. See more on [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)
-	mocha - Unit test tool. See more on [http://mochajs.org](http://mochajs.org/)
-	jspm - Don't need compile the code, it uses babel (or traucer or typescript) to run ES6 code on browser. Know more in [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/)
-	gulp - Automate and enhance your workflow. See more about gulp on [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

##### Code Style and Hinting

On the root directory you will find **.jshintrc** and **.jscsrc**, these files are helpers to maintain syntax consistency, it signals syntax mistakes and makes the code equal for all developers.

-	[jscs](http://jscs.info/) - Maintain JavaScript Code Style
-	[jshint](http://jshint.com/) - Detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.

All IDE's and Text Editors can handle these tools.

#### <a id="Tasks">Tasks</a>

 - [Documentation](#documentation)
 - [License](#license)
 - [Dist](#dist)
 - [Build](#build)
 - [Encode](#encode)
 - [Watch Hyperty](#watch-hyperty)
 - [Watch](#watch)

##### <a id="documentation">Documentation</a>

To generates api documentation you can run

```
gulp doc
```

##### <a id="license">License</a>

This task put in each file inside the src folder, the license;
If, for some reason, you need to remove from all files the license run the command with the argument `--clean`;

```
gulp license
```

##### <a id="dist">Dist</a>

To distribute the runtime-core, you can make a distribution file.

Run the command:`
gulp dist
`

###### <a id="build">Build</a>

To distribute the runtime-core, but with the source code maps, and to detect where is some error.

Run the command:`
gulp build
`

###### <a id="encode">Encode</a>

In this repository, we have some tasks which can help you. If you need change some resource file, like an Hyperty or ProtoStub, and load it to the Hyperties.json or ProtoStubs.json, run the following command, and answer to the questions;

```
gulp encode

```

you need to answer this questions: File to be converted? > resources/VertxProtoStub.js

Configuration file like an object or url to ProtoStub have on configuration: > something like: {"url":"wss://msg-node.localhost:9090/ws"} or only wss://msg-node.localhost:9090/ws

This will be a default file to be loaded? (yes/no) > yes or no

// TODO: optimize this to read if it is an hyperty or protocol stub;

###### <a id="watch-hyperty">Watch Hyperty</a>

If you need change some resource file, like an Hyperty, you need run this task first. This task will be covert ES6 to ES5 and encode the Hyperty file changes in a base64 file and add it to the descriptor folder in the respective place;

in your command line run:`
gulp watch-hyperty --dest=resources
`

###### <a id="watch">Watch</a>

if you need watch all changes on src folder and convert them to a dist file, run:

```
gulp watch
```

This will convert all the files from ES6 to ES5 and update the distribution file;

#### Unit Testing

Unit testing can be launched manually with **karma start**.

~~It's advisable to use [expect.js](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js) instead of assert.~~

After investigate and testing the [expect.js](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js) it don't support some features for ES6, because this tool hasn't activity at some time, that is why, it is recomended use the [chaijs](http://chaijs.com/) it is more versatile and have expect.js (but updated) and others tools that can be useful;

The address data factory can be tested independently by calling

```
cd <base folder>/test
mocha addressFactoryTest.js
```

#### <a id="example">Example</a>

*to be moved to My First reTHINK Applications?*

This repository have a folder with an working example of Hyperty Connector and we can send message and make a WebRTC call between remote hyperties through the vertx;

To run the demo on example folder: - this example have a dependecy from [dev-msg-node-vertx](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/tree/dev-0.2#unit-testing) and [dev-registry-domain](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain#dev-registry-domain) for communication between hyperties in two distinct browsers or tabs. **At this moment you need run locally [dev-msg-node-vertx](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/tree/dev-0.2#unit-testing) and [dev-registry-domain](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain#dev-registry-domain)** - you need, in the root folder, run command: `npm start` - in your browser, access to https://127.0.0.1:8080/example

This example works over https protocol, but since we are running in the 127.0.0.1, this address is considered secure and the webRTC will works well;
